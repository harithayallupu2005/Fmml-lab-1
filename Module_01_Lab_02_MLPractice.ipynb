        "**Ans:** The size of the train and validation sets can affect how well we can predict the accuracy on the test using the validation set.If we have a larger training set,the model can learn more patterns and potentially perform better on the test set. However,if the validation set is too small,it may not accurately represent the test set,leading to less reliable predictions of accuracy. It's important to find the right balance between the sizes of the train and validation sets for accurate predictions."
